## Client

The client for this application is built using React Native. To start the Expo server run:

```
npm run client
```

## Server

The server for this application hosts an api using Express and Node.js. It fetches from an [API](https://rapidapi.com/mmcardle-drx9FYQNK/api/canadian-gas-prices/) I built for current gas prices and the Google Maps API for locations and route distances. To start the Node server, go to the /server directory and run:

```
npm run start
```
